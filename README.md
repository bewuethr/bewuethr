### Hi there :wave:

It's Tuesday! I'm currently attending the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=90d9bc776f490dab14675dbf7b143cae). I'm probably reading the [Pickaxe book](https://pragprog.com/titles/ruby5/programming-ruby-3-2-5th-edition/).

Weather in Brooklyn: partly cloudy, at +29Â°C.
